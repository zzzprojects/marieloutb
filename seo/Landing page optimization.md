# Landing page optimization

## What is a landing page? 

A landing page is a page of your website accessed by clicking on a hyperlink. When people refer to their landing page, they often refer to their home page, since they like to think that’s the first page viewed by user and an entry page giving an introduction to their business. 

## What is a SEO friendly landing page and why it matters?

Landing pages are often not ranking as well as other pages since they often don’t contain enough content, links, images, etc. Not optimizing that page is losing a great opportunity. A visitor who found you quickly will see their experience improve and will be more likely to interact with you. 

Landing pages are often structured to create a marketing funnel to direct customers through stages resulting in sales. Adding too much SEO content can damage the funnel since it creates more distraction. There should be a balance between the two. Afterall what would be the point of having that marketing funnel in place if no one finds you… More organic traffic result in more potential buyers entering your website and SEO increase that type of traffic. 

## How a SEO landing page should be?

-	FAST: to rank well in search engines your page needs to be loading quickly, also a slow website usually has a high bounce rate which is also affecting the ranking. 
-	Useful interesting content
-	URL: should be short, include your business name and if possible a keyword (ex: https://www.peoplesjewellers.com/)
-	Headers should include keywords
-	Long page, high word counts

-	Meta title, Meta description should also include keywords
-	Landing page should always be mobile-friendly
