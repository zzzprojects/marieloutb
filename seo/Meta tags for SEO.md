# Meta tags for SEO
Meta gags are a snippet of text that describes what a website contain. They are invisible tags that provide important information to all search engines. 

Meta tags are important even now in 2020 but to rank well, you also must create good content and have a website that user can actually enjoy. 

Meta tags are inserted in `<head>` section of an HTML document. 

## Types of Meta Tags 

Here is a small definition of important tags you should know:

1. **Title tags:** specify to search engines and reader what your page is about. We recommend using between 55 and 60 characters.  

*Example of syntax*
```
<head>
<title>Enter Title here</title>
</head>
```

2. **Meta Keywords:** Meta keywords give insight to what your page is about. They used to be a valuable part of SEO, but search engines devalued them since they were overly use.  You can still use them, but they don’t have a huge impact and you should make sure that they really reflect the content of your web page. 

*Example of syntax*
```
<head>
<meta name=”keywords” content=enter meta keywords here>
</head>
```

3. **Meta Description:** Gives a small description of your website that must be under 160 characters. Your description will determine if users click on your link, it is worth spending time to optimize it. The description must be representative of your website. 

*Example of syntax*
```
<head>
<meta name=”description” content=”Enter the description here”>
</head>
```

4. Meta Robots: This is to tell the web crawler of the search engine what to do with your website.  You can select if you want the web crawler to **follow** links in your page and you want it to be **indexed**.

*Example of syntax*
```
<meta name=”robots” content=”index, nofollow”>
```

5. **ALT tag:** Since images can’t be read by search engines crawler, adding alt text to images allow them to be considered and have an impact the ranking. 

6. **Social media tags:**

- Open graph tags: include integration of social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, Google +, etc.
- Twitter Cards: same thing for twitter only
