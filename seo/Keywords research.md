# Keywords research

## What are SEO keywords?

*SEO keywords* are the keywords people are writing in search engines to find a website. 
 
*Keywords research* is the process of finding terms people are using when they research for an information, a service or a product. Once you know what people are asking for, you can insert their words or phrases in your related content to be easier to find using search engines.

## Why do you need to do keywords research?

-	**Increase organic traffic:** Adding SEO keywords is important since it allows you to bring significant organic traffic to your site. Researching those keywords is essential to be certain that your efforts will make a difference. 
-	**Optimize existent content**: When you find out what people are researching you can adjust your content by modifying your existent content to be more SEO friendly.
-	**Insights to create new content:** A big advantage of Keywords research is to have insights to what people are asking about your product. Research made by your potential clients let you know what hesitation they might have, what they are looking for, etc. 

For example, if I have a business selling smartwatch. A simple search using autocomplete answer on google can tell me that people want to know about smartwatches:
ARE…: safe, waterproof, worth it, etc. 
How…: They work, track sleep, measure stress, track steps, etc. 
When…: They go on sale, they came out, etc.
With these questions in mind it is much easier to add information that might be missing and create new content or even new products.
